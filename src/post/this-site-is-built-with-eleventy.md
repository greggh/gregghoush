We're working hard to get the show ready to go. One of the first pieces for me was rebuilding [gregghoush.com](https://gregghoush.com) on some newer technology. I wanted to go for speed and real optimizations. For that, I needed to use a static site generator (the JAMStack). After researching for a few days, I decided to use Eleventy. It's initial simplicity, while allowing me to get as complex as I wanted, was perfect.

These are the tools used to build the website you are currently viewing:

- IDE: [Panic's Nova](https://nova.app)
- Static Site Generator: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)
- CSS Framework: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Javascript Framework: [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- Search: [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io)
- CSS Minifier: [PostCSS](https://postcss.org)
- Javascript Minifier: [Terser](https://terser.org)
- HTML Minifier: [HTMLMinifier](https://kangax.github.io/html-minifier/)
- Sitemap Generator: [eleventy-plugin-sitemap](https://github.com/quasibit/eleventy-plugin-sitemap)
- YouTube Responsive Embeds: [Embed Everything](https://gfscott.com/embed-everything/)
- RSS & Atom Feeds: [eleventy-plugin-rss](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss)

This website is my first project with the JAMStack, and I am happy with the look and the speed, but I am sure I have done things pretty clumsy in the code. Usually, this would mean I don't want to show the code to anyone, but this time, I will open up the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/greggh/gregghoush) to anyone who wants to learn some Eleventy skills from it.
There are a few people I want to thank for code and answers that I learned from:

- Greg Wolanski and his great article and starter project, [An Eleventy Starter with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js](https://css-tricks.com/eleventy-starter-with-tailwind-css-alpine-js/)
- Zach Leatherman for creating Eleventy and the starter project, [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)
- Peter deHaan for multiple answers on GitHub that are required reading for Eleventy users, [GitHub](https://github.com/pdehaan)

If anyone wants to send in a pull request that cleans up the code or makes it faster, I would be happy to merge in better code.
