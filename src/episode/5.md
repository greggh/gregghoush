Epsiode #5 is here! Tonight we got to talk with Daryle Lamont Jenkins who has been fighting the good fight against far-right neo-nazis and racists for more than 30 years. Daryle talks with me about the beginnings of his work against racists in the late 80s and into the early 90s, what got him involved, and where he is now.

In this episode we talk about the Proud Boys and all of the various copycat groups. We also talk about Charlottesville and the documentary Daryle is in about it.
