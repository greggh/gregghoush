The guest last night was my good friend Alex Winter. A lot of my viewers are fans of Anonymous and hackers in general. Most people in the world don't know just how computer savvy Alex is, and we got to have that part of the conversation which was great. We talk about his early days in the 80s getting online with usenet and BBSes. We spent a lot of time talking about the documentaries he's directed and produced, and other media fun.

Topics covered:

- The new Frank Zappa documentary
- Bill & Teds Excellent Adventure
- Early computer usage and internet fun
- Napster
- Media piracy
- Movies like Freaked and Lost Boys
- The Panama Papers
- The Blockchain and cryptocurrency like Bitcoin
- And a lot more!
