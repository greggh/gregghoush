This is our first one-hour episode. We covered Mutual Aid, local organizing, activist, and volunteer burnout, and a lot of other things related to helping your neighbors through all of this.

Our guest for this episode on mutual aid was James Meickle who helped organize and still helps run our local group in my current hometown of Malden, MA.

As always: SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE SO WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS!
