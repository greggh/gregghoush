This week Friday fell on Christmas. We spent the evening talking about trolling Q / QAnon out of existence, Christmas, right-wing protesters heading for DC and their dox, and of course rambling on for at least an hour of viewer questions and conversation.

It was a lot of fun, I hope you enjoy the Christmas Special.
