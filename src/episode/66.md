Kevin Gallagher A.K.A. ageis was a good friend, a great activist, and dedicated to a point that is rare to find.

Tonight I talk about my friend and his passing. We talk about mental health in our community and the need to do more. I introduce people to who Kevin really was, and the amount of work he actually put in. A lot of it was hidden and unseen by the public. He was an unsung hero of the movement.

Topics covered:

- Kevin Gallagher has passed away.
- Losses in our community.
- Commander X has been taken from Mexico by the US government.
- Kirtaner rolls over an ATV and goes to the hospital.
- and a lot more!
