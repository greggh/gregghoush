Fan of the show R00by hops on the episode to fill in for a last-minute guest rescheduling. The show was great, and I'm really happy to have such an awesome group of people watching the show.

Topics covered:

- Was Prince Phillip a nazi?
- Matt Gaetz is somehow still in congress.
- How many Supreme Court justices do we need? 20?
- Amazon workers fail to unionize, getting only 16% to vote for it.
- Organizing chat logs from the White Lives Matter movement leak.
- and a lot more!
