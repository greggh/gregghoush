In this episode, we talk with Barrett Brown and get updates on the projects he is working on:

- ProjectPM
- Pursuance
- Project Swartz
- Project Hastings

We spend some time talking about the tools they are working to make available, and Barrett invites everyone over to the new ProjectPM IRC to join the projects.
