We have a special episode tonight to address the Mike Jones situation. Kirtaner is back for his first back-to-back episodes.

Mike Jones is someone who we just found out exists, but has been convincing people he has been involved with Anonymous for more than a decade. And in his own chat has said that I have a beef with him going back to 2003. I did not know this man existed until a few days ago.

This is a fun episode.
