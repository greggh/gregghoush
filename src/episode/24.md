In this episode we talk about organizing against local fascists, and what you can do against nazis in your town. Anna and friends held an event in our local town that all of the leadership was invited to. The mayor and city counselors showed up. At this event, people spoke about the fight against the far-right, fascism, and explained that it was not only a national issue but also a very local issue.
