Tonight we got to talk to an old friend of mine, AJ. A Boston local who goes to cons, does cosplay, shows up at fun protests, and generally is a fun guy to know.

We spent the night talking about cons over the last 20 or so years, meeting through a cult, cosplay and how that all works, and a new project to do and out creeps who go to cons to prey on kids. So the show is mostly lighthearted, but we do get to some heavy subjects.
