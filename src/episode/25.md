In this episode we talk about the downfall of Parler, where it might be going, what happened, and the fact that they were not hacked. The data was accessible publicly and easily.

We also talk about what's next for #QAnonâ€‹ and the rest of those idiots. Including some discussion about the insurrection.

The most fun, we do a lot of audience interaction in the chat.
