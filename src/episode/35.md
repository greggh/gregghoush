Friday's with Kirtaner are always fun, join us as we talk about:

- Gina Carano making a movie with Ben Shapiro
- Anonymous and Telecomix supporting Myanmar's people.
- Louise Mensch thinks Kirtaner did everything that has ever happened.
- The Lincoln Project might have committed a crime...
- Trumps Lawyers ignore questions, lie, and walk off when they feel like it at the impeachment.
- Kirtaner and the chat wonder what it would take for me to do drugs or drink alcohol. They find out again that it won't happen.
- Should DDOS be protected protest action / speech?
- Kirtaner teams up and does a 2v2 hacking competition.
- Extras don't like me on set.
- And a lot more!
