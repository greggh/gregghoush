Kirtaner Friday’s really are the highlight of my week. I don’t know where I would be without these at the end of every week.

Topics covered:

- A defcon talk that never happened.
- Is Kirt going to talk at defcon?
- Haters join chat to make the show more entertaining.
- John McAfee has sex with whales.
- Myanmar’s government moves systems back to paper.
- Should Cloudflare protect certain sites, is it censorship?
- Gab is getting what it deserves, and Andrew Torba befriends Demons.
- and a lot more!
