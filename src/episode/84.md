Welcome Gregg Housh to the show.

I've let Ubuntu on my mail server get 2 full LTS versions out of date. Upgrading to the latest Mailinabox v65 will require me to upgrade Ubuntu to 22.04. The instructions say to set up a new server install from scratch, and then restore a backup. That does not sound like fun.

So, in this video, we do in-place upgrades all the way up and fix all the bugs that are introduced.
