In this episode, we talk about the fun OANN leak from about an hour before the show. We also discuss the support all the grifters on the right give to other grifters, and why the people on the left don't do the same.

Aubrey updates us all on the latest Parler data, news articles coming out, and what is happening next.

Last but definitely not least we agreed that we all needed an outlet and we're gonna do a regular game night!
