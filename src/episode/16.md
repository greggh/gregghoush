I was sick all Friday and most of Saturday so we moved Friday's live episode to Saturday night in the hopes that some rest would fix me up. Worked good enough, and we had an awesome show!

We talked about joining Parler and how crazy it is for John to be inviting #Anonymous onto the platform with open-arms. We rambled on about multiple current news topics like the SolarWinds hack. And the most fun we always have is with the audience participation in the chat, so there was a lot of Q&A with the fans.

As always: SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE SO WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS!
