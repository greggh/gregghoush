Evan is one of my best friends, but life took us in different directions on many projects, hobbies, and even work. So we don't keep up with each other enough. I reached out to see if we could catch up live in front of an audience, because why not?

The hours before the show changed a lot of the discussion, as a group of domestic terrorists who support Trump stormed the Capitol Building. And we ended up talking a lot about that event, the people behind it, and what's coming next.

As always: SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE SO WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS!
