Me and Kirtaner run a Saturday show to make up for me being unable to do Friday night. This was a fun episode.

Topics covered:

- Joe Buck sucks, Jeopardy should hire LeVar Burton already.
- Apple Arcade has a new horrible game.
- Shootings are now every single day.
- US Police spending is now 3x China's entire military budget.
- and a lot more!
