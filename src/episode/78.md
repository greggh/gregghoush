Welcome Gregg Housh to the show.

Thanks for watching my first stream back. This is somewhat of a test stream. I give chat an update on what has been happening, and they help me test my setup (volume, lighting, etc...). We do a lot of this while I play Minecraft just to have something happening on screen.
