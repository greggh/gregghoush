SickCodes joins me to talk about the John Deere disclosure, and their handling of it. We spend a lot of time attempting to prove a security researcher acted correctly, and the company are being dicks (SickCodes does indeed prove this).

Topics covered:

- John Deere is vital to our food supply.
- John Deere has been vulnerable to multiple exploits.
- Rob Dyke vs. Apperta.
- Apperta had customer data exposed on GitHub.
- and a lot more!
