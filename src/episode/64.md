Kirtaner Fridays!

Topics covered:

- The CFAA's scope is narrowed. AUP's aren't worth the paper they are written on.
- Washington Supreme Court says independent journalists aren't media/press.
- Norton decides your anti-virus should mine crypto, because why not.
- Session App might be awesome.
- Stack Overflow was bought by Prosus, we remember the last few times sites like this got bought and put behind paywalls.
- Trump gets banned from Facebook for 2 years.
- Tank Man censored on Bing (and by extension Yahoo and DuckDuckGo)
- Minneapolis starts to tear down George Floyd Square.
- and a lot more!
