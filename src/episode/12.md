Joe Fionda joins me for a fun show with an old friend. I've known Joe since the early days of Occupy. We talk about the past, about all our fun at Occupy, and some fun future plans.

We also get to hear about Joe's time in Italy during the beginning of the pandemic, and his trek back to the US right in the middle of it all.

As always: SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE SO WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS!
