This fun Friday with Kirtaner we talk about Parler and how much better he is doing on the platform than me. We also talk about a new anti-qanon project and its Discord.

Could MrBeast become the leader of a dystopian future where we see his smiling face everywhere?

We talk some politics, including about the $2,000 stimulus and Mitch McConnell being a turtle.

And of course, we talk all about New Years Eve!
