In this episode we talked about way to many subjects to list, as we always do on Friday nights with Kirtaner!

Some of the topics covered:

- Celebrating the loss of a monster as Rush Limbaugh died.
- DeepFuckingValue tells Congress that he likes the stock.
- Myanmar protests, hacks, going back to paper.
