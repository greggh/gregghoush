Welcome Gregg Housh to the show.

I've replaced the Fifine mixer with a Rodecaster Pro II, and it's awesome. Just like the first stream back, me and chat test the equipment and make sure the sound and lighting is good. We also talk more about what the future is going to look like for the streams and a lot more.
