Tonight we had one of my good friends, Chris Caesar, on the show. He is a local who I met when he reached out as a journalist working on a story. He has moved around a lot since then from various journalism and writing jobs. But locally everyone knows him as a bit of a rabble-rouser and someone we all enjoy watching troll local right-wingers online.

We talk about the local alt-right and fascists getting arrested for their roles in the Capitol riots and insurrection.
