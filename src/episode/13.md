Tonight we talk for over 3 hours about a lot of fun stuff, some serious things, and in general we just have a lot of fun with everyone in the chat.

Topics range from the leak / release of 8kun's mail logs to some history behind the early Anonymous videos.

Kirtaner is great all night, we talked about his new penetration testing devices that he will be crowdfunding in the near future, and I think everyone is going to enjoy that section of the video.
