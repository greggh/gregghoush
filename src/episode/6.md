In today's episode, we see the possibility of a little tradition starting. We had a lot of fun last time Kirtaner was on, and today was even more entertaining to me (and I hope the audience).

We talked about the ongoing battle with QAnon, which Q is definitely losing (more on that next week). There was a lot said about various security measures you should be taking if you want to have any "fun" on the internet regarding security. We should probably do a much longer episode in far greater detail on that in the future, and we will.

Kirtaner told us a little about running an imageboard, which is a type of website like 420chan or 4chan. And we just generally had a good time interacting with chat and answering questions.
