Here in Episode 9, we talk to my wife Anna Geoffroy about Mutual Aid. We had James Meickle on last week to talk about organizing a local Mutual Aid group. For this episode, we talk more about the details, like what food works best for this, what scams to look out for, and how to work with other locals like the mayor's office and non-profits.
