We were lucky enough to have Vermin Supreme on the show, and it was as good as you expect from him!

We talked about Ponies, Libertarians, the 2020 presidential race, and so much more.

Vermin Supreme announced that an exploratory committee has been formed to explore the idea of forming an exploratory committee about possibly running for Governor in 2022!

If you like Vermin Supreme the man, the myth, the legend, then you'll love this episode.
