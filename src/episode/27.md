Mike is a local activist here in Massachusetts. He's been working on causes for a long time, and tonight we talk about some of them. We spend a lot of time talking about the insurrection and the politics of it all.

During this show my computer crashes, hard. Every application but the video conference and Streamlabs OBS crash. So the stream still sort of works, but the rest of the system is dead. It made for a wild ride.

Mark Sahady getting arrested was a big topic, and we all love seeing the local fascists get whats coming to them.

As always: SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE SO WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS!
