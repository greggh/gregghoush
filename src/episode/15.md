Some heavy topics, some good answers, last night we talked with Petrona and AWKWORD of Ten Demands for Justice.  From their website:

Ten Demands for Justice envisions a new society in which prisons and police are no longer necessary, and communities are equipped to provide for their own health and safety.

The Ten Demands:
1 — DEFUND THE POLICE AND REALLOCATE RESOURCES TO IMPACTED COMMUNITIES
2 — DEMILITARIZE THE POLICE
3 — ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATORY POLICING, PROSECUTION, AND SENTENCING
4 — INSTITUTE COMPLETE LAW ENFORCEMENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
5 — INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGATE ALL POLICE CRIMES AND ABUSES OF POWER 
6 — INSTALL COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION, OVERSIGHT, AND SAFETY MEASURES 
7 — END STRATEGIC COUNTER-PROTEST VIOLENCE 
8 — APOLOGIZE AND PROVIDE REPARATIONS
9 — END THE WAR ON DRUGS
10 — END CARCERAL PUNISHMENT

We covered all of these in the episode, and there is a lot more information on their website.
